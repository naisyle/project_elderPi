# __Projet ElderPi__

## Introduction: 
The scope of this university project was conceived entirely with the usage of a Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat in mind.
The Raspberry Pi is a mini-computer the size of a credit card, yet it offers vast possibilities.
In addition to the Raspberry Pi, the project utilizes a Sense HAT expansion board. This expansion board provides a large number of sensors, peripherals, and accompanying functionalities.
The request from our client, the Belgian State's Health service, is to create a connected tool for elderly people, allowing them to record shopping lists and remember their secret codesâ€”these could include PINs, access codes, etc.

It is also crucial to make the usage of this tool as simple as possible, with potential additional functions that would provide added value for users.

## Features
* Auto-Rotate of LED Matrix
* Pin Code Saver
* Grocery List 
* Wellbeing Station 
* Accessibility Option : Usage of voice commands
